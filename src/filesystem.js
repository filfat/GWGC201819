    Due to unforeseeable consequences several crew members
    from the Discovery 2 (XD-2) have been stranded on the
    remains of an unknown vessle.
    
    It's now your job to make sure they complete their mission
    and arrive safely back at the Discovery 2 (XD-2).
    
    We're counting on you!
